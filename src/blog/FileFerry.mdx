  FileFerry is a browser-based, peer-to-peer file sharing application that
  allows for secure, direct file transfers between any two browsers. Inspired by
  the command-line utility magic-wormhole, it uses WebRTC and the libp2p
  library. The project implement a custom protocol for reliable transfers over
  unstable connections, including checksum validation and an acknowledgement
  system, built with TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

# FileFerry: Building a Secure, Peer-to-Peer File Sharing App from Scratch

![Flow Chart](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/smp46/FileFerry/main/public/favicon/web-app-manifest-192x192.png)

## Motivation

I'm a big fan and user of the file-sharing utility
[magic-wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole). An
easy-to-use utility that allows you to transfer a folder or file between any two
devices running a magic-wormhole client, using a phrase to connect. However, the
client is, in my opinion, the limiting factor. It is usually a command-line
utility, requiring both a command line and a computer to run it on. Although it
can be run through Termux on Android, that's not quite the user experience I'm
after. So what if I could bring magic-wormhole to the browser?

## Initial Idea: Literally Bring Magic-Wormhole to the Browser

Being the genius I am (_sarcasm_) I thought I could literally just bring the
wormhole-client to the browser. My preferred client is
[wormhole-william](https://github.com/psanford/wormhole-william), an
implementation of magic-wormhole written in Golang. A cool feature of Golang is
that anything _can_ be compiled to WASM, WebAssembly. So I thought I could just
make a web interface for wormhole-william, compile it to WASM and boom,
browser-based file sharing!

No, that's not how it works :(

## Peer-to-Peer in the Browser and its Limitations

While WASM is super cool tech, a browser is still a browser. And that means
[limitations](https://thenewstack.io/webassembly/case-study-a-webassembly-failure-and-lessons-learned/).
For today, the important limitation is "You cannot access the network in an
unpermissioned way." This means the traditional and established method of TCP
hole-punching to establish direct network connections between two otherwise
unconnected peers doesn't work. I guess this is understandable, but it did throw
a spanner in the works. Magic-wormhole works _exclusively_ via TCP
hole-punching, a fact I discovered only after building a basic prototype in the
browser.

So what can you do in the browser?

[WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
and [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) are
what you can do in the browser. WebSockets are our equivalent of a basic TCP
stream in the browser. The WebSockets API "makes it possible to open a two-way
interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server."
Which sounds pretty neat, I'm going to need to make some connections beyond HTTP
requests. And WebRTC "enables Web applications and sites to ... exchange
arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary." Sounds like
exactly what I would need for a browser-based file sharing application, how
easy. With WebSockets for creating streams and WebRTC as our transfer protocol,
all it needs is some magic to get the direct connection.

## The (Imperfect) Magic: libp2p

Libp2p is what I used to build FileFerry, and it is awesome. As a whole, libp2p
is a specification for bringing together a lot of cool networking technologies
into a single framework. And look right there in the blurb it says it supports
Javascript, hole punching and direct browser-to-browser communication.

Okay, so the scope of the project has increased a little... but it seems I have
the tools to make my browser-based alternative to magic-wormhole.

## Building FileFerry with js-libp2p

This has been a long journey, and let's just say I'm glad Neovim doesn't keep
track of usage by number of hours.

### Wrangling js-libp2p

While js-libp2p does handle the magic, it isn't exactly simple nor
straightforward. I started with this
[webrtc browser-to-browser example](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private/)
and went from there. Unfortunately, while libp2p has some cool built-in
protocols like gossip-sub for chat apps, it doesn't offer a file transfer
protocol. It _doesn't_ offer a file transfer protocol, so that was my job to
implement. But in theory if I can get a stream, I should be able to just push
some data through it, save it on the other end and boom, file-sharing done.
Well, in a perfect world maybe, but I found WebSockets and WebRTC isn't exactly
tailored to shoving large amounts of data through a stream as fast as possible.
Connection stability was a gigantic headache, connections _will_ drop and
handling that is a pain.

### Complete Transfers over Incomplete Connections

The general idea seemed easy, if I just track at an application level how far
through a file transfer the app is then if a connection drops, it can reconnect
and keep on going. And that's how I started. But there are issues:

- How do we know when to reconnect?
- How do we know that the data arrived all in one piece?
- What if the Sender gets ahead of the Receiver?

To address the first issue, I implemented a Connection Management class that
keeps track of, handles and directs connections. I also made it the Sender's job
to reconnect upon connection loss. It sounds simple now, but working out how the
specific implementation required a lot of reading of the
[libp2p spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs), reading the
[source code](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p) and trial and error.

The second issue was much easier, and dare I say fun. Hashing to produce a
checksum. Now most hashing I can think of works by taking a complete file and
processing it all at once. But only the Sender has a complete file, at least
until the transfer is done. Instead of having the Receiver process the whole
file again and hash it after receiving, I decided I could do it during the
transfer. I could do it during the transfer, this way it would be less of an
issue if the connection dropped as well. So I picked an algorithm I had actually
used in the Algorithms and Datastructures class I took at uni, FNV1a because it
is
[very fast and relatively secure](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/49550/which-hashing-algorithm-is-best-for-uniqueness-and-speed/145633#145633).
Okay so now the Sender makes the initial checksum part of the file header and
the Receiver can compare its final result against it. Another issue down.

The final issue, I also solved thanks to some networking basics I was taught at
uni. The stream behaves like a UDP connection, you can write and read data to it
but who is to say whether that data did or didn't arrive. So I thought what if I
took a page from TCP and implemented an *ACK*nowledgement system. Basically,
every 200 chunks the Sender will stop sending and wait for the Receiver to send
an acknowledgement that it has received the last batch. This helped especially
when connection drop-outs occurred, often the sender would reconnect and keep
blasting data while the receiver is still trying to catch up.

### A (Poorly Made) Overview

### The UI

The nautical theme was picked mostly because I was looking for something
interesting. As I'm not a UI designer, it felt easier to make something a little
different. The site uses purely HTML/Typescript/TailwindCSS. And I'm not ashamed
to admit Claude Opus was definitely the lead CSS designer, I thought it was
pretty incredible the stuff it can come up with purely in CSS. Zero pre-rendered
assets (images) are used, it's all CSS, SVGs and text.

### The Backend

To bring it all together, I self-host two of the three required back-end
servers:

- **The Passphrase Server**: A simple API that provides access to a database. A
  sender can make a POST request with a key value pair of their passphrase (the
  key) and their public peer address (the value). A receiver, with a shared
  passphrase, can then make a GET request (with the passphrase) and receive the
  Sender's peer address. The database entry is then immediately deleted.
- **WebRTC Necessities**: For a more detailed explanation of exactly how these
  two servers come into play I suggest
  [this article](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/turn-server/). But
  simply put:
  - **The CoTURN Server**: The fallback relay that is used if a direct
    connection can't be made between two clients.
    [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is just an open source
    implementation that I utilised for this project.
  - **The STUN Servers**: These are public external services that help with
    client discoverability and establishing direct connections with WebRTC. As
    these use very little bandwith, there are many publicly available. I used
    [this list](https://github.com/pradt2/always-online-stun) and my own
    [fork of a GeoIP API](https://github.com/smp46/geoip-api) to retrieve the
    three geographically closest STUN servers to the client.

## To Conclude

This turned into a really fun and challenging project, and has definitely
inspired me to work further with the libp2p framework in the future. Due to the
complexity of the project I spent a long time getting into the weeds, reading
and trying to understand the source code of js-libp2p. I ran into many problems
that neither Google nor ChatGPT could help me with, which made it a very
rewarding project to complete.

But for now, I am finished with FileFerry and will enjoy my new easy way to
share files in the browser.
