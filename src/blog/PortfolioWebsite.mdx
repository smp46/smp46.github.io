# Building My Developer Portfolio with Next.js, MDX, and GitHub Actions

This is the website you're on right now! It covers an intro to my projects (like
this one) and a little about who I am.

## Features

- Written in Typescript with NextJS/React.
- Fully dynamic will scale (well) to most devices.
- Website is entirely statically generated.
- Articles (projects) are written in MDX format and get compiled automatically
  as a Github workflow.

## How the Markdown stuff works

Painfully! It was a lot of banging my head against the wall using various guides
and resources to reach my goal of _easier_ article creation / updating. What
ended up being the most helpful article was
[this one by Colby Fayock](https://spacejelly.dev/posts/how-to-source-mdx-content-in-next-js-to-dynamically-create-pages-for-a-blog).

The end result is a relatively easy way to maintain and add articles/project
write-ups. The process is as simple as:

1. Write the article in Markdown(X) and copy it to the src/projects directory.
2. Add the required fields to the top of the page, to extract a title and allow
   for categorising, meta tags etc. For example:

```
---
title: "Portfolio Website"
subtitle: "Building My Developer Portfolio with Next.js, MDX, and GitHub Actions"
type: "personal"
description: "A fully statically-generated personal portfolio built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It showcases projects, articles written in MDX, and a bit about me."
keywords: "personal website, portfolio, Next.js, React, TypeScript, static site generation, MDX, GitHub Actions, web development, developer portfolio"
github: "https://github.com/smp46/smp46.github.io"
---
```

3. `git add . && git commit` And ta-dah, the Github workflow handles the
   compiling and then it goes live at
   [smp46.me/projects](https://smp46.me/projects).

### Testing/Building

Requirements: `npm 10.9.2` - ymmv with other versions

For developing `npm run dev`, this even works for adding MDX files. Navigating
away then back to /projects, will refresh and get new files.

For building/generating a static site `npm run build`, find the website files in
/out.
