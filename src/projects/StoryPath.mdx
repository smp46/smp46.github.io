# StoryPath: A Location-Based Platform for Interactive Tours & Treasure Hunts

StoryPath is a location-based experience platform built for virtual museum
exhibits, interactive tours, and clue-driven treasure hunts. It includes both a
React Web App for creating experiences and a React Native App for exploring them
in the real world.

### Tech Stack

Frontend Web: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios

Mobile App: React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Axios, Expo

Backend: Provided REST API or local JSON Server, ChatGPT API

## Website

The StoryPath web app provides a project creation interface with a REST API
backend that gets shared with the app.

### Features

- Create and manage location-based projects

- Add Locations to each project, with support for custom content including
  images for each location.

- Print unique QR codes for each location for discovery via the mobile app

- Use a basic Preview Mode to simulate the app experience

- ChatGPT integration to enhance or get feedback on project content

## Companion App

The StoryPath mobile app (React Native) enables users to play experiences
created on the web platform. Once a user creates a profile (locally stored),
they can browse available projects and start exploring. Locations are unlocked
by physically visiting them or scanning the associated QR code. Each discovery
updates the userâ€™s score and reveals the next clue.

### Features

- Create a player profile with name and photo

- Browse and select from a list of published projects

- Follow clues to find locations

- Unlock locations by entering a geofenced area or scanning a QR code

- View your current location and unlocked spots on a map

- Track your score and progress through the experience

- See participant stats for each project/location

## Setup Instructions

The app and website _can_ be run locally with the caveat that the API has just
been reimplemented with json-server. And the ChatGPT functionaility won't work
without providing API keys in the .env file.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18.x recommended)

- Yarn or npm

- Android Developer Studio (for emulation) or a mobile device with the Expo App
  installed.

#### Website Setup

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/smp46/StoryPath.git
cd React\ Website/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

This starts the web app at http://localhost:5173.

##### Mobile App Setup

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/smp46/StoryPath.git
cd React\ Native/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```

You can scan the QR code from your terminal or browser to open the app on your
phone using the Expo Go app.
