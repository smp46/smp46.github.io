# dockerImageServer: Docker Image Server for Periodic Image Fetching with Nginx

This Docker container downloads an image from a specified URL at regular intervals and serves it via an Nginx web server. I'm publishing it here in hope that someone else might have a use for it. My use case is fetching a snapshot image from a security camera on my local network and exposing it safely behind a nginx web server that can then be put behind a reverse-proxy.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Docker command-line usage.

## Configuration

Configuration is handled through environment variables. The following variables can be set:

- `IMAGE_URL`: The URL of the image to be downloaded and served. (Required)
- `SLEEP_INTERVAL`: The interval, in seconds, between each image fetch. Defaults to `5` seconds.

## Quick Start

**Docker Run**

  ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 \
    -e IMAGE_URL=your_image_url_here \
    -e SLEEP_INTERVAL=10 \
    ghcr.io/smp46/dockerimageserver
  ```

**Docker Compose**

  ```yaml
    dockerImageServer:
      container_name:  dockerImageServer
      ports:
          - 8080:80
      image: ghcr.io/smp46/dockerimageserver
      environment:
        - IMAGE_URL=your_image_url_here
        - SLEEP_INTERVAL=10
      restart: unless-stopped
```
This will start the container and begin serving the image at http://localhost:8080.

## Build from Source

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smp46/dockerImageServer
   cd dockerImageServer

2. Build the Docker Image

    ```bash
    docker build -t dockerimageserver .

3. Run the Docker Container.
  
    Replace your_image_url_here with the actual URL of the image you want to serve and optionally adjust the SLEEP_INTERVAL.

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 \
      -e IMAGE_URL=your_image_url_here \
      -e SLEEP_INTERVAL=10 \
      dockerimageserver

This will start the container and begin serving the image at http://localhost:8080.
