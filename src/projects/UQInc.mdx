# How to Run
### From Source
UQInc requires rust and cargo in order to run. 
To start, in the terminal run:
```
git clone https://github.com/UQInc/UQInc.git
cd UQInc
cargo run
```
### From Pre-Built Executables
Pick the executable for your platform [here](https://github.com/UQInc/UQInc/releases/)!



From there the game will open and you can begin clicking and buying upgrades to play.
Upon completion the buildings menu on the right hand side will be empty and the map will be complete.
Each building purchase will award 1 perk point which can be spent in the perks menu to increase the 
number of students per click and the amount of money you get per student.

# GUI
Made using the macroquad library.
