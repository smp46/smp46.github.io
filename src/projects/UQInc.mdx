# How to Run

### From Source

UQInc requires rust and cargo in order to run. To start, in the terminal run:

```
git clone https://github.com/UQInc/UQInc.git
cd UQInc
cargo run
```

### From Pre-Built Executables

Pick the executable for your platform
[here](https://github.com/UQInc/UQInc/releases/)!

From there the game will open and you can begin clicking and buying upgrades to
play. Upon completion the buildings menu on the right hand side will be empty
and the map will be complete. Each building purchase will award 1 perk point
which can be spent in the perks menu to increase the number of students per
click and the amount of money you get per student.

# GUI

Made using the macroquad library.
